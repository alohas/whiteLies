     <h1>WHY NOT TO DRINK MILK</h1>
     <div class="first milks">
         <h2>Myth 1: Skim milk is the healthiest option</h2>
         <p>Milk and other dairy products are the top sources of artery-clogging saturated fat in the American diet. Milk products also contain dietary cholesterol. Diets high in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease, which remains America’s top killer.<br>
Milk and other dairy products are the top source of saturated fat in the American diet, contributing to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have also linked dairy to an increased risk of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.</p>
     </div>

     <div class="second milks">
         <h2>Myth 2: Milk is  the best beverage source of calcium</h2>
         <p>Other drinks have comparable amounts. With 30 percent of your daily value of calcium in one cup, milk is by no means a shabby source of the mineral. But it’s not your only option for calcium, which helps bones, muscles, the heart and nerves. A cup of calcium-enriched orange juice has 35 percent of your daily need, and enriched soy milk can serve a whopping 45 percent.</p>
     </div>

     <div class="third milks">
         <h2>Myth 3: Drinking Milk means stronger bones </h2>
         <p>I know what you’re thinking: “That’s impossible! Milk is full of calcium” – True, it is full of calcium (about 300mg per glass) but we just aren’t able to make use of it.
The calcium in raw milk is absorbed by humans to some degree (although drinking the milk from another animal still seems to be a questionable practice) but after pasteurization we are able to absorb very little calcium at all.
In fact, since milk is slightly acidic our body has to work to neutralize it. Calcium happens to be an excellent alkaline element so it can be used as an acid-neutralizer. Where would your body find calcium? That’s right, your body can actually pull it from your bones leaving them calcium-deficient and weaker!</p>
     </div>

     <div class="fourth milks">
         <h2>Myth 4: Milk is nature’s perfect food for humans</h2>
         <p>Cow’s milk might be ideal for growing baby cows, but it’s far from a perfect food for humans. More than 60 percent of people are lactose intolerant, which can lead to uncomfortable symptoms like cramping, diarrhea, and bloating. Regular consumption of dairy products has also been linked to prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.</p>
     </div>

     <div class="fifth milks">
         <h2>Myth 5: Kids need milk to be healthy</h2>
         <p>After babies are weaned from breast milk or formula, they do not need any type of milk to be healthy. Milk consumption during childhood has even been linked to colic and type 1 diabetes. Another study found no evidence that low-fat milk plays any role in preventing childhood obesity.</p>
